# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, youâ€™ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources
- Data source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter notebook 6.4.8

## Results

Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

After obtaining a new data frame that displays Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver for each city type we can conclude the following.

- Rural rides are on average more expensive than Suburban and Urban rides with an average cost of $34.62. The average fare for each driver will also be the highest among each city type with a value of $55.49 per driver. The amount of total rides and drivers will always be lower in rural cities. This benefits the few drivers in rural areas since the average fare will be very high.

- Suburban rides have an average cost of $30.97. The average fare for each driver has a value of $39.50 per driver. The amount of total rides and drivers will be in between rural and urban areas.

- Urban rides are on average less expensive than Suburban and Rural rides with an average cost of $24.53. The average fare for each driver will also lower with a value of $16.57 per driver. The higher the amount of demand for a ride, the higher the number of drivers that can be found in that area. This is not good for each driver since the average fare will lower.

After reviewing Total Fare by City Types, we can confirm that the more populated the the area is, the more the overall profit will be higher. We can also see that by grabbing the first 4 months of 2019, the fare prices are stable making prices independent from the time of the year.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

## Summary

Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
